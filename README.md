This example demonstrates a common but subtle error in COBOL programs. When moving numeric values, it's crucial to ensure the receiving field has sufficient capacity, including the correct number of decimal places.  Failure to do so leads to silent data truncation, potentially causing inaccurate calculations and unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle decimal places, either by using appropriate data types or explicitly truncating the value with appropriate checks.
